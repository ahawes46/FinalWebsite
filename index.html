      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p3>My name is Alexis Hawes. I am a twenty three year old software engineer currently residing in San Diego,
        California. As an avid gamer and lover of languages, here are some of the things I'm interested in: </p3>
      <ul>
        <!--Creating a bullet list of interests-->
        <li>Video games and their development and localization</li>
        <li>Sports Analytics and Data</li>
        <li>AI and related tools such as ChatGPT and MidJourney</li>
      </ul>

      <p3>Take a look around and feel free to <a href="#contact-me">contact me!</a></p3>

      <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
      <!--setting anchor point-->
      <p3>After graduating from the University of Maryland with a degree in Russian Language and Literature, I realized
        I missed programming more than I thought I would. Rather than go back to school, I decided to enroll in
        Thinkful's program as it allowed me to go at my own pace while connecting me with people in the industry.</p3>
      <br>
      <p3>In my free time, I love to travel, read, watch sports, and spend time with my family and friends. I speak
        Russian and Spanish, and I love that growing my skills as a software developer is a lot like learning a new
        language. If you're looking to hire a new developer, please reach out. </p3>
